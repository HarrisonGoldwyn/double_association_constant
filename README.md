# double_association_constant

This repo contains a single notebook that takes chromaphore absorption data at different concentrations 
of some complexing agent and calculates the association constant. The data is fit to a 2 compinent model 
outlined by Demerter and coworkers (JPCA A 2007, 111 (37), 8942-8949 and JPCA 2004, 108 (19), 4357-4364.).

As written, this assumes only the chromophore and complexes of the chromophore absorb in the spectral window. If both species independently absorb in the spectral window to be analyzed, changes must be made to the code.
